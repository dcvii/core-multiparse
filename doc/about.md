Core Multiparse 


This was developed in 2014 in response to a requirement that several flat text reports could not be acquired directly from the databases that built them. So I built a system that allowed me to make a library of parsing rules based on regex that could identify and extract financial data accurately.

This code allowed me to build a framework for keyword frequency analysis. Since then I have used modifications of this framework to assist in WAF analysis and build sophisticated rule-based filters.

Although this code is old and not particularly elegant using any known patterns, it was highly reliable and produced exactly what was necessary. I also built the corresponding database consumer and the full data workload implementation in the AWS cloud.
